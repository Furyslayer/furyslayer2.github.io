# PollDaddyBallotStuffing

Web page with auto voting bot

Goal : 
Provide an easy to use tool to automagically vote in a polldaddy vote, to people without any technical know-how
Just Share a link and the voting starts

What's availlable now:
a configurable autovoting bot. configured through the link, has to be made by hand, sharable.

example : https://damnalex.github.io/PollDaddyBallotStuffing/index.html?poll=9794855&ans=44811670


What needs to be done:
 - make the interface easy to use
 - fix this page
