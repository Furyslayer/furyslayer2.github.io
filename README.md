# PollDaddyBallotStuffing

Web page with auto voting bot

Goal : 
Provide an easy to use tool to automagically vote in a polldaddy vote, to people without any technical know-how
Just Share a link and the voting starts

What's availlable now:
a static web page for the final of the radiotime podcast and radio championship, this is juste the base made by RebelKeithy.

What needs to be done:
 - make the bot configurable and sharable
 - make the interface easy to use
 - fix this page
